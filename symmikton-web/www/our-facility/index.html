<h2 id="lines">Lines</h2>

<p>Technologicaly advanced machinery gives Symmikton S.A. the capacity to comprehensively address a wide range of steel structures that require production of welded profiles or processing of standard structural steel.</p>

<p>Our facility is based on 5 independent lines:</p>

<h3 id="beam-line">Beam line</h3>
<p>Automated cutting, drilling and marking of structural steel with section width up to 1,200mm. The accuracy of the machinery is +1/-1mm (non-cumulative). Drilling can be done on 3 axes simultaneously, with 8 different options for the diameter of the holes.</p>

<h3 id="punching-line">Punching line</h3>
<p>Automated cutting, drilling and marking of steel angles and plates. Automated CNC machinery employed includes;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Angle punching for steel angles from 40 x 40mm to 160 x 160mm</li>
  <li>Plate punching for steel plates up to 1000 x 800 x 25mm</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="operations--capacity">Operations &amp; Capacity</h2>

<p>In order to achieve the verticalization of these lines, our company has formed a <strong>Structural Steel Design Department</strong>, with experienced engineers and designers. There, we develop models in <a href="https://eng.ccs.gr/software/steel-structures/instant-steel/">Instant Steel</a>, a specialized structural solutions software, produce shop drawings in <a href="https://www.tekla.com/us/products/tekla-structures">Tekla Structures</a>, and push them to the CNC machines through a dedicated terminal to automate production and minimize errors.</p>

<p>Our factory also operates as a cutting-edge <strong>Service Center</strong> for any steel structures contractor. Utilizing the unmatched benefits of our equipment, a contractor can achieve low costs and fast delivery times for structural steel processing works. In the international market, Service Centers are popular since they enable top construction quality without the need for heavy up-front investments.</p>

<p>The flagship project that showcased the huge production capacity of Symmikton S.A., was the construction of the 10,500 ton steel frame for the <strong>International Broadcast Center</strong> in 2002. The project was completed in 5 months (June-October), with our company processing 2000 tons of structural steel per month. This level of speed and efficiency constitutes an insurmountable record for the Steel Structure market in Greece.</p>
